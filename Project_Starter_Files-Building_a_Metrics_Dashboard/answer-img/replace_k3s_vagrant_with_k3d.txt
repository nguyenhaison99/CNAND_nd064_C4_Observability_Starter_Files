I'm using MacOS M1 and have Docker installed
-> Instead of using vagrant and k3s, I'll be using k3d which also deploy k3s using as containers.

Command to deploy k3d:
k3d cluster create my-cluster --servers 1 --agents 0 --port 8080:80@loadbalancer --port 6443:6443@loadbalancer

k3d kubeconfig merge my-cluster --kubeconfig-switch-context
